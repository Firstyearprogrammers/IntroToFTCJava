This is going to be a list of websites and resource pages where you can find a lot of the resources for programming.
Some of them are a littel outdated, but contain very relevant infromation.

The FTC Programming Resources page:
URL: https://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/ftc/technology-information-and-resources

Description:
This page contains many tutorials on the basic setup and programming of many of the systems
that FTC uses to program, including: Android Studio, onBot Java, and Blocks

The Android Studio FTC App Master examples page
Found under FtcRobotController/src/main/java/org.firstinspires.ftc.robotcontroller

Description:
These are various examples of tele-ops, autonomous's, sensor examples, servo and motor examples,
and vision system examples using vuforia. These can help you with almost any problem you have,
but although these examples are here, most only show the data from the sensors and not how to use them.

FTCKey.com
URL: ftckey.com

Description:
This website also contains many programming tutorials and examples. Last updated during the
Velocity Vortex season two years ago, it contains programming examples over various drivetrains,
sensor data manipulation, control of motors, and examples of various autonomous programs.

Youtube
URL: youtube.com

Description:
You can learn almost anything you need to know about FTC, Android Studio, and programming in general 
from youtube. This is because the problems that you encounter have probably happened to other teams before
and these teams have graciously given their time to show you how to fix your problems.
